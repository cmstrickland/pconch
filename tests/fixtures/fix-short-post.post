I stumbled across a reference to the [RMS Mülheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_RMS_Mulheim), and ended up in a wiki-hole. This German cargo ship was wrecked at Land's End in 2003, in apparently bizarre circumstances.

> On investigation, it was discovered that the chief officer—who had been on watch at the time—had caught his trousers in the lever of his chair when trying to get up, causing him to fall and rendering him unconscious."

This brings to mind those periodic surveys about accidents in the home, wherein you learn that something inauspicious, like the toothbrush, is a significant factor in a majority of domestic fatalities. When I looked into it a little more, I did notice that trousers are involved in a surprising number of domestic incidents. In [this article from 2001](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1373209.stm), they get the blame for _6000 accidents a year_.
